# discreteDiffWaves

This repository contains the code used to numerically validate the results in Dieterle and Amir (2020). The notebook NDMDnInf_gitHub contains the code for diffusive wave propagation in all-dimensional systems as the Hill exponent, n, goes to infinity. The notebook 1D1DAllOrder_gitHub uses cubic interpolants to compute the diffusive wave dynamics for one-dimensional systems.

The Mathematica notebooks contain figure making materiel.
